# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- User registration, login, and authentication:
  - memory: `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/me` endpoints (bcrypt password hashing + JWT issuance).
  - orchestrator: `/auth/*` reverse proxy plus JWT enforcement on `/query/*`, `/cart/*`, `/orders/*`, and `/context/*`.
  - web: login/register page, token persistence, auth headers on API and SSE requests, account page with logout.
- `JWT_SECRET` environment variable in `.env.example` and compose.

### Fixed

- orchestrator config loader now opens YAML with `encoding="utf-8"` so non-ASCII configs load correctly on Windows.
- compose `milvus` service now exposes ports `19530`/`9091` so a locally run `search` can reach Milvus.
- Docker builds now use the correct service contexts, Python package layout, Node.js 22 runtime, and frontend API variable.
- Docker build contexts now exclude `.env`, local overrides, virtual environments, databases, and generated dependencies.
- safety configuration paths are normalized across Windows and Linux, and local overrides no longer leak into container images.
- timing responses now remain positive on clocks with coarse timer resolution.

### Changed

- `docs/deployment-guide.md`: document `JWT_SECRET` setup and add a 401 troubleshooting note.
